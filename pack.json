Breakthrough therapies launched over the past decade for multiple diseases are reshaping patient care in many areas and the outlook for medicines use \u2013 and the related spending - through 2028 is higher than prior forecasts as more novel drugs become available and despite a significant downward revision of the outlook for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.\n\nThe largest driver of medicine spending growth through the next five years is still expected to be the availability and use in developed markets of innovative therapeutics and offset by losses of exclusivity and the lower costs of generics and biosimilars. Traditionally, innovative medicine growth has occurred most in the years immediately following launch, whereas recent years and the forecast outlook show growth driven by older products. This mix of spending growth between volume-driven growth, and mix-driven changes in the cost of therapy are showing most geographies shifting to more expensive therapies, reflecting the broader availability and patient access to medicines with higher clinical value.\n\nIn this report, we quantify the impact of these dynamics and examine the spending and usage of medicines in 2023 and the outlook to 2028, globally and for specific therapy areas and countries. We intend for this report to provide an evidence-based foundation for meaningful discussion by all stakeholders about the value, cost, and role of medicines over the next five years in the context of overall healthcare spending.\n\nThe study was produced independently by the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science as a public service, without industry or government funding.

            "Text": "START OF PAGE: 4\n\n2 | Global Use of Medicines: Outlook to 2028\n\n# Overview\n\nSignificant usage shifts and spending growth acceleration across geographies became apparent in 2023 and have contributed to an increase in the outlook for medicine spending through 2028 of two percentage points to 5-8% CAGR, bringing global spending on medicines at list prices to $2.3tn. This is at the same time the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted to endemic and the outlook for vaccinations and therapeutic spending has been revised downward by nearly $200Bn, driven by lower usage and offset by rising prices.\n\nGlobal health systems have demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of the pandemic, global inflation, and regional conflicts, and have moved forward to adopt novel therapies and increase usage overall. Overall, global use and spending on medicines is exceeding pre-pandemic growth rates and is expected to continue significantly above those trends through 2028.\n\n## OUTLOOK FOR THE USE OF MEDICINES AND DRIVERS\n\nThe volume use of medicines globally plateaued in 2023 but is expected to grow at an average 2.3% rate through 2028, driven by China, India and other Asian markets all growing faster than 3%. Countries in Latin America have grown more rapidly than other regions in the last five years and are expected to grow further at 1.9% annually through the forecast. North America, Western Europe and Japan are expected to grow medicine usage more slowly, partly due to their already higher per capita use. In 2024, Eastern Europe volume growth is expected to return to trends present prior to the start of the Ukraine conflict.\n\n> **Overall, global use and spending on medicines is exceeding pre-pandemic growth rates and is expected to continue significantly above those trends through 2028.**\n\n## THERAPY AREA DRIVERS OF MEDICINE USE\n\nMedicine use for specific therapy areas has been growing since 2018, with notably high growth in immunology, endocrinology, and oncology. These areas of rising usage have been driven more by wider adoption of older therapies compared to newer medicines.\n\nImmunology treatments have seen a steady 12% rise in utilization but the rates of per capita usage have varied considerably even within wealthier developed countries. Overall, nearly half of immunology biologic volume is facing biosimilar competition in developed markets, which has led to an incremental 5% in usage as more patients use treatments as costs decline.\n\nGLP-1 agonist medicines have been approved for both diabetes and obesity indications and have seen rapid uptake since 2021, coinciding with U.S. obesity approvals.\n\nAnother area of notable medicine use shifts has been the use of antibacterials, which was significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic but returned to historic levels in 2022 and 2023. There remains a concerning reduction in the rates of adult vaccinations as many countries are vaccinating at rates below their pre-pandemic trend, leaving an estimated 100 million fewer doses administered since 2020.\n\nSome notable localized disruptions in usage were triggered by climate events in recent years, a pattern expected to be more common and severe in coming years. In cases where wildfires, floods and hurricanes have had unexpectedly severe impact, specific medicines have seen spikes in demand for necessary medicines, or disrupted or displaced prescriptions, impacting patients' health and requiring resilient health systems and supply chains.\n\n## SPENDING AND GROWTH BY REGIONS AND KEY COUNTRIES\n\nThe global medicine market \u2014 using list price levels \u2014 is expected to grow at 5\u20138% CAGR through 2028, reaching about $2.3Tn in total market size. It is expected that manufacturer net sales will be lower than this due to the impact of confidential rebates, government mandated discounts and clawbacks. In the U.S. net manufacturer sales are expected to be 47% lower than invoice prices, reflecting these factors.\nEND OF PAGE: 4",

            "Text": "START OF PAGE: 5\niqviainstitute.org | 3\n\nand five-year growth will be 2-5%, 4% lower than invoice projection of 6-9%. In the U.S., these projections include a significant upward revision from the prior forecast of -1 to 2% growth through 2027 and reflect multiple drivers of higher growth along with similar estimates for constraints related to pricing reforms.\n\nThe major European countries (Germany, France, Italy, Spain) as well as the U.K. have historically had net spending as much as 2% lower than list price trends, though official data on net spending are not available for more recent periods, and the impact of net price mechanisms are expected to be more significant if growth trends accelerate. Spending in Europe is expected to increase by $70Bn on a list-price basis through 2028, driven by new brands and offset by generics and biosimilars.\n\nJapan medicine spending growth is projected at -1 to 2% through 2028 as robust brand growth is offset by a shift in annual price cuts and ongoing moves to generics. Spending growth in China is expected to slow, with positives driven by greater uptake and use of new original medicines and offset by pressures on off patent and generic pricing. Latin America, Eastern Europe and parts of Asia are expected to grow strongly from volume and adoption of novel medicines.\n\nSpending globally is expected to grow by more than $600Bn, reaching $2.3Tn driven by existing branded medicines in the leading ten developed markets, which will grow by $385Bn. New products will add $193Bn but will be offset by the impact of patent expiries, removing $192Bn. Other developed markets and fast-growing Pharmerging markets will together add another $184Bn. In each of these cases, growth drivers are an acceleration over the past five years, reflecting a rebound from the disrupted 2019-2023 period.\n\n**KEY THERAPY AREAS**\n\nThe key growth area for medicines in the next five years is biotech, which despite growth slowing will still increase by 9.5 to 12.5% and represent $890Bn in spending in 2028, a projected 39% of the global market and will include many of the areas of greatest activity for novel medicines. Specialty medicines \u2014 those treating chronic, complex or rare conditions and often characterized by high cost, special distribution or handling, and the inherent complexity their conditions imply \u2014 are expected to represent 43% of global spending in 2028, and more than 55% of leading developed markets.\n\nThe two leading global therapy areas \u2014 oncology and immunology \u2014 are forecast to grow 14\u201317% and 2\u20135% CAGR, respectively, through 2028. Oncology is projected to add 100 new treatments over five years, contributing to an increase in spending of $224Bn to a total of more than $440Bn in 2028 and facing limiting new losses of exclusivity. Treatments for auto-immune disorders are forecast to reach $192Bn globally by 2028, driven by steadily increasing numbers of treated patients and new products in some new immune disorders, and offset after 2023 due to biosimilars. Diabetes spending growth is slowing to low single digits in most developed markets and declining in some, especially net of rebates. Global obesity spending has accelerated in the past two years as highly effective novel GLP-1 agonists are gaining wider adoption and are expected to accelerate further, reshaping obesity treatment and the health outcomes of millions if insurers and governments support wider reimbursement.\n\nNew therapies in Alzheimer\u2019s and anxiety/depression are expected drive growth in neurology and mental health spending. The outlook for next generation biotherapeutics includes significantly uncertain clinical and commercial prospects for cell, gene, and RNA therapies, which will grow from current $10Bn spending in 2023 to $33Bn by 2028 and add as many as 50 novel therapies in those five years.\nEND OF PAGE: 5",

Access has been declining for the past five years and is expected to remain steady over the next five years, potentially counteracting other policy initiatives to improve health in those countries.\n- It is important to interpret these trends with caution, as chronic diseases drive many days of therapy and treatments for them are often much less common in lower income countries.\n\nNotes: Chart represents IQVIA Institute estimates of global defined daily doses (DDD).

The increases were driven by Brazil, lifting regional DDD in 2028 48% higher than 2018, while the region excluding Brazil will reach an index of 132 in 2028, still above the global average but slower than the fast-growing Asian region.\n\n- Brazil\u2019s growth has been driven by widening use of predominantly low-cost therapies but is expected to shift to higher cost therapies as the forecast progresses.\n\n- China, India and other Asian markets have had above average volume growth and are expected to continue through the forecast.\n\n- Higher income countries in North America, Europe, and Japan are expected to see a slight improvement in their outlook for the use of medicines, though essentially continuing a steady trend typical of these more established health systems.\n\nNotes: Defined Daily Doses (DDD) are based on WHO definitions where each medicine is assigned a volume of medicine per day (see definitions & methodology). All charted values are indexed to 2018 values set equal to 100. 2023 volume is based on actual data as of June 2023 and projected for the remainder of the year.\n\n6 | Global Use of Medicines: Outlook to 2028\n\nEND OF PAGE: 8",

Greater access to these medicines are the mark of a well-managed health system, while excessive use suggests inappropriate stewardship and risks antimicrobial resistance.\n- The impact on volume seen across regions in 2020 and 2021 shows the clear effects of social distancing and mask-wearing around the world, as these policies were widely adopted in the height of the pandemic, and antibacterial use was reduced dramatically at the same time.\n- As the global pandemic has eased, the volume rebounded to just below the pre-pandemic trend and declined in 2023, although many regions show increases on a per capita basis.\n- Only Japan, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and North America had an increase in per capita use in 2023, although only Eastern Europe\u2019s use exceeds the pre-pandemic rate.\n- One of the key drivers of antibacterial use has been a rising intensity of seasonal respiratory infections in the winter 2022 and 2023 seasons, potentially as a result of weakened immune systems from COVID-19, flu, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).\n- The rebounds noted to date also coincide with reported shortages in antibacterials in many major markets (see Drug Shortages in the U.S. 2023, IQVIA Institute, Nov 2023).\n\nNotes: Asia-Pacific does not include China, India, and Japan. 2023 volume is based on actual data as of June 2023 and projected for the remainder of the year.\n\n16 | Global Use of Medicines: Outlook to 2028\n\nEND OF PAGE: 18",

Overall doses declined sharply in 2021 and 2022.\n- Based on the degree of decline across geographies it is estimated that 100 million fewer doses have been administered in those two years than if the pre-pandemic trend had continued.\n- While immunization rates for adult vaccines are low across countries globally, the pandemic had a disproportionately negative impact on adult vaccine doses in countries that are in the medium or low category on the United Nations human development index.\n- This measurement of adult vaccine doses is based on IQVIA MIDAS data, based primarily on collection of data from wholesalers and providers including hospitals and pharmacies. This serves as a proxy for adult vaccination coverage as real time adult vaccine coverage data is highly variable by country and oftentimes very limited. MIDAS provides a directional view on trends in vaccine coverage globally.\n\n### Notes\n\n- Adult vaccinations include influenza; diphtheria and tetanus (Td); diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (TDaP); hepatitis B; herpes zoster and pneumococcal.\n- Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccinations in combination with polio or hepatitis B are not included.\n- A 75:25% adult: pediatric split for influenza and 1/3:2/3 split for pneumococcal has been applied in accordance with available adult and pediatric coverage (UK and US).\n- Only hepatitis B doses of 1mL or larger were assumed for adult use.\n- Includes retail and non-retail from 76 countries covered by IQVIA MIDAS panels.

Neither outlook were modeled including COVID-19 vaccines and the estimates of vaccine spending are entirely incremental spending. Vaccine costs reflect medicine costs only and do not include costs from provider administration or government contributions to manufacturing or distribution costs. COVID-19 therapeutics are novel therapeutics including antivirals and antibody treatments new to the market but excluding existing medicines \u2018repurposed\u2019 for COVID-19. No confidential or proprietary information is included in these estimates.\nEND OF PAGE: 23",

It remains possible that updated publications could revise these estimates upward.\n- Most countries have announced plans to prioritize immuno-compromised individuals and the elderly and limit funding support for wider vaccination, with the U.S. shifting payment to traditional insurance payers in the fall of 2023.\n- The lower rates of COVID-19 vaccination also coincide with many countries shifting to co-administration of the vaccines with flu shots.\n- As the virus is now endemic, with periodically identified new variants, the vaccine formulations will continue to be re-issued and likely used more often if infections surge.\n\nNotes: Scenario modeling was conducted by the IQVIA Institute based on public information as of October 2023. Estimates of future vaccination trends include input from the public statements of responsible agencies and manufacturers, as well as modeling by the IQVIA Institute. Estimates of cost per patient are based on assumptions of the number and mix of doses of available vaccines, the published prices, and IQVIA Institute estimates of the prevailing prices that will exist across geographies through 2028. As costs are based on public statements, they may overstate the true costs after negotiated discounts. Doses are based on the expected dosing including booster shots.\n\n  \n22 | Global Use of Medicines: Outlook to 2028  \n\nEND OF PAGE: 24",

As of November 2023, the expected brand declines of adalimumab in the U.S., facing biosimilars since January 2023 and accounting for $5Bn of the modeled impact in 2023, have resulted instead in an increase in brand spending on an invoice basis as biosimilar uptake has reached only 1.4% of prescriptions.\n\n- The next five years of expiry events will provide critical revenue opportunities for generic and biosimilar makers to sustain their businesses, especially considering the more modest period of expiry events in the past five years, which were historically low levels.\n\n- Payers\u2019 ability to generate savings from these expiry events will offset novel and inline brand spending and be a key element as health systems and payers work to control the rate of growth in drug spending.\n\nNotes: Totals may not sum due to rounding.

Brand spending includes all brands and is not limited to novel active substances (NAS). NAS are defined as medicines available for the first time where at least one ingredient is new. Estimates for 2023 global NAS are based on information available as of September 2023 (59 confirmed launches) and historic patterns of the remaining three months relative to the full year from prior years.\n\n26 | Global Use of Medicines: Outlook to 2028\n\nEND OF PAGE: 28",

OTC and other products were estimated and added to complete the view of the market. Analyses do not include COVID vaccines and therapeutics.\n\niqviainstitute.org | 37\nEND OF PAGE: 39",

Increasingly, original branded products are being launched by domestic originators rather than by multinationals, a pattern reshaping the market in China with implications for other countries in the region and around the world.\n- Over the next five years, original brands will grow by 7.5% per year while other types of products will grow at 6% or less, contributing to the overall growth rate slowing to 2\u20135%.\n- Non-original brands, including versions of medicines originated by multi-nationals, are the second largest segment of spending in China but are expected to grow by less than 1% per year, partly as a result of a government focus on curbing spending growth in hospitals.\n- By 2028, China is projected to exceed $197Bn, an increase of more than $30Bn in the next five years.\n\nNotes: Original brands are those marketed by their originator (or licensed partner) and includes vaccine products by all manufacturers. Analysis does not include COVID-19 vaccines or therapeutics.\n\n38 | Global Use of Medicines: Outlook to 2028\n\nEND OF PAGE: 40",

when patent enforcement is less stringent, these are referred to as \u2018copy products.\u2019\n- Developed countries typically have higher shares from original branded products but vary to the degree they shift usage to generics or non-original products after patent expiry, contributing to differences in spending share for originators including those that are off-patent.\n- Pharmerging and lower income countries have lower shares of spending from originator products, with a greater focus on either generics or non-original branded products, and all products typically have lower prices.\n\nNotes: Developed countries refer to the top 10 developed markets (U.S., Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, UK, Canada, South Korea, Australia. Other developed include countries from the World Bank\u2019s income segmentation, and include high and upper-middle income countries, with the exception of pharmerging markets. Pharmerging markets are those with per capita GDP by purchasing power parity (PPP) <$30,000/year and forecasted 5-year aggregate pharma sales growth >$1Bn (absolute or rounded) in at least two forecasts. Note that Pharmerging and Other Developed segments have been revised with this edition, with several countries now being included in Other developed which were previously Pharmerging.

IQVIA Institute, Nov 2023.\n\n- The relative amount of medicine spending has been shifting over time with some fast-growing countries becoming more important to the total level of global spending.\n- Volume growth, often of older generic medicines, has been the primary driver of growth in many Pharmerging markets, although the more recent rising rankings ahead of leading developed markets are also driven by shifts in the mix of spending.\n- China has been the second largest global pharma market for more than a decade but has begun to grow more slowly than the U.S., reflected in the declining index of spending from 23.0% in 2023, projected to be 20.0% in 2028.\n- The growth in pharma spending levels along with rising PPP-adjusted GDP per capita has resulted in some formerly Pharmerging countries now being classified as \u2018other developed\u2019 in other analyses in this report, including Russia and Turkey, among others.\n\nNotes: Rankings are based on US$ with variable exchange rates at list prices. Changes in rank are compared to 5 years previously, and the number of ranking positions indicated with a number. All country spending is compared to the U.S. which is set to 100. Spending does not include COVID vaccines or therapeutics. See Definitions & Methodology for Pharmerging countries.\n\n40 | Global Use of Medicines: Outlook to 2028\nEND OF PAGE: 42",

Major advances are expected to continue, especially in oncology, immunology, diabetes and obesity. Notable small molecule innovations are also expected in these diseases as well as neurology.\n\niqviainstitute.org | 41\n\nEND OF PAGE: 43",

While IQVIA invoice prices reflect supply-chain price concessions, they do not reflect the off-invoice discounts and rebates separately paid to insurers, or other price concessions paid to patients or other health system participants. Estimates of net manufacturer revenue and prices are based on a sample of companies and products where details are reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and where the volume of sales captured in IQVIA audits is consistent with information provided directly by manufacturers in support of IQVIA proprietary datasets. Net prices are calculated by dividing publicly-reported net sales values by volumes for the same products reported to IQVIA. Estimated brand net price growth for the total market is projected from the analysis sample to the total market. Net prices represent an estimate of the average manufacturer realized price, reflecting any reductions in net revenues due to off-invoice discounts, rebates, co-pay assistance, or other price concessions, and do not necessarily reflect the net costs paid by insurers, the federal government or patients, which all vary significantly and independently.\n\n**NEW ACTIVE SUBSTANCES (NASs):** Medicines are considered a NAS if at least one active ingredient has not been previously marketed globally.\n\n**SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS:** IQVIA defines specialty medicines as those that treat chronic, complex or rare diseases, and that have a minimum of four out of seven additional characteristics related to the distribution, care delivery and/or cost of the medicines.\n\nChronic diseases are long-lasting and often without direct cure, and treatments are intended to be used for more than six months.\n\nComplex diseases have both environmental and genetic components, meaning they may be hereditary and/or exacerbated by environmental factors (e.g., obesity, diet, etc.). Complex diseases can affect multiple organ systems and may be caused or be the cause of secondary diseases (e.g., diabetes can cause renal failure such that both are considered complex diseases).\n\nRare diseases are defined as those with fewer than 200,000 new cases annually, equivalent to the U.S. definition of orphan diseases, but not exclusively linked to the granting of an FDA orphan drug designation.\n\nAdditional product characteristics, where a product must exhibit four of the seven to be considered specialty are:\n\n- Costly: list price is in excess of $6,000 per year\n- Initiated/maintained by a specialist\n- Requiring administration by another individual or healthcare professional (i.e., not self-administered)\n- Requiring special handling in the supply chain (e.g., refrigerated, frozen, chemo precautions, biohazard)\n- Requiring patient payment assistance\n- Distributed through non-traditional channels (e.g., specialty pharmacy)\n- Medication has significant side-effects that require additional monitoring/counselling (including, but not limited to, REMS programs) and/or disease requires additional monitoring of therapy (e.g., monitoring of blood/cell counts to assess effectiveness/side effects of therapy).\n\n54 | Global Use of Medicines: Outlook to 2028\nEND OF PAGE: 56",

Within the developed markets are a subset focusing on the 10 largest countries with high incomes and pharmaceutical spending greater than $15 billion. These countries are Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, the UK, and the U.S.\n\n**PHARMERGING MARKETS** are defined as countries with per capita GDP by purchasing power parity (PPP) <$30,000/year and forecasted 5-year aggregate pharma sales growth >$1bn (absolute or rounded) in at least two forecasts. These countries are Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam.\n\n**LOWER INCOME COUNTRIES** includes lower-middle and low income countries using the World Bank\u2019s bands, with the exception of Pharmerging markets.\n\nWorld Bank Income Bands such as high, upper middle, lower middle, and low are based on World Bank methodologies. For current World Bank classifications, see: https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519\n\n**INNOVATION INSIGHTS** is IQVIA\u2019s proprietary product classification system, categorizing products as original brands, non-original brands, unbranded, OTC, or other on the basis of a selection of product attributes.\n\n**WHODDD** \u2014 The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a method of normalizing medicines of varying intended doses using a defined daily dose (WHO-DDD). The WHO-DDD measure is intended to represent a standard day of therapy for a maintenance dose of a chronic therapy. The WHO-DDD measure does not reflect actual treatment decisions and is not derived from distinct patients measured with anonymized data. The WHO-DDD guidance is provided online (see https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/) but does not include factors or guidance for all drug products. Distinct numeric factors are provided in relation to milligrams or international units (IU) depending on the medicine, or in terms of number of pills per day in the case of chronic medicines such as hypertension. WHO provides guiding principles for calculating DDDs for fixed-dose combination products. The IQVIA institute has developed additional factors using the same or highly similar concepts to represent more than 75% of audited standard unit volume globally. DDDs have been estimated for other products based on the standard unit to DDD ratios per product type and therapy area in each country, where specific DDD values have been determined. In unaudited countries, IQVIA Market Prognosis collates sales values from international trade data for the pharmaceutical sector. The IQVIA Institute has used audited data in geographically adjacent countries to infer various characteristics from this international trade data, including standard unit volumes. DDD in these countries has been estimated based on standard unit to DDD ratios in adjacent countries. DDDs in unaudited countries represent 5% of global estimated DDDs.\nEND OF PAGE: 57",
